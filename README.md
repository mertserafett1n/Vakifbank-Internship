# Vakifbank-Internship
This project was developed during my internship at VakıfBank.
It includes backend development with C# and a simple frontend built with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
The main goal of the project was to gain hands-on experience with full-stack development in a banking context, focusing on practical implementation and learning.
⚠️ This is an internship project — there might be incomplete features, small errors, or platform-specific differences.
